This project provides CA pedestrian simulation that is based on the article

Crociani, L. and LÃ¤mmel, G. (2016). Multidestination Pedestrian Flows in 
Equilibrium: A Cellular Automaton-Based Approach. Computer-Aided Civil 
and Infrastructure Engineering, doi: [10.1111/mice.12209](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/mice.12209/abstract)

Currently, the simulation strongly depends on [MATSim](matsim.org).
